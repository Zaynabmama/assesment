## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zaynabmama/assesment
   cd assesment
   npm install

## Firebase Setup

To set up Firebase for the application, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Click on **"Add project"** and follow the prompts to create a new project.

### 2. Add a Web App

- Once the project is created, click on **"Add app"** and select the web icon (`</>`).
- Register your app and click **"Continue to console"**.

### 3. Get Firebase Configuration

- After creating your web app, you'll be provided with Firebase configuration settings (API key, Auth domain, etc.).
- Copy these settings, as you will need them for your `.firbase.config.ts` file.

### 4. Enable Firebase Services

- In the Firebase console, enable the necessary services (like Firestore, Authentication, etc.) that your application will use.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


## Running unit tests (will add it)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
